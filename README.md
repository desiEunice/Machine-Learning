# Machine-Learning

Find my code for various machine learning algorithms written from scratch with numpy in this repository.

## Description
 
This is a collection of my homework and projects that I did in my machine learning class with Dr.Bojian Xu from the computer science and electrical engineering department at Eastern Washington University. This repository contains programs on the following machine learning algorithms:

- Perceptron Learning Algorithm
- Gradient Descent & Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression 
- Neural Network
